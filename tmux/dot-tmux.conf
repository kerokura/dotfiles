# EXAMPLES

##Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:
#
#set-option -g status off
#set-option -g status-style bg=blue
#
##Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of inactivity:
#
#set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
#set-option -g lock-after-time 1800
#
##Creating new key bindings:
#
#bind-key b set-option status
#bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
#bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
